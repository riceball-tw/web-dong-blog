In previous projects, there were no specific guidelines on how to define values in the UI, leading to magic numbers (values without specifications or descriptions) spreading throughout the product, causing significant issues.

Therefore, during this architectural overhaul, I reviewed Figma's documentation on Design Tokens and summarized a new article to guide the team in quickly understanding how to manage UI variables in digital products through the following three classification methods:

- Primitive Variable
- Semantic Variable
- Component Variable
