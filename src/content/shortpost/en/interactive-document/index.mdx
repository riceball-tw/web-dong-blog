Adding interactivity to documents to avoid monotony, there are some details or niche requirements in website planning that are easily forgotten, and it's always too late when the problem is discovered. For example:

- Multilingual support
- Page Meta information
- Complete UI component states
- â€¦

Therefore, writing a checklist makes it easy to quickly verify or help newcomers get started, but such documents are often only looked at a few times before no one revisits them ðŸ˜…. Who likes to flip through documents for no reason!

Instead of "suggesting" to check document A when performing action A, perhaps creating an SOP checklist without unnecessary words, following the "required" process, might lead to a greater sense of accomplishment and accuracy. The [Checklist Design](https://www.threads.net/@webdong.dev/post/C8uA0A7hi9V) website has many excellent SOP documents, such as best practices for components, pages, or designs.
