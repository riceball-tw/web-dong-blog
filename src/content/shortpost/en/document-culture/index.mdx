I really want to improve team documentation, but I always find it hard to find time to record experiences and consensus. Even when documents are recorded, there is no time to digest them, and they often get forgotten in some corner.

The recent goal is: in the product, I hope to start trying to implement a BDD (Behavior-driven development) model that integrates testing, development, and business in new projects, allowing different fields to jointly maintain and collaborate on unified documentation. As for the fragmented knowledge and pitfall experiences, they are currently managed and recorded in Notion, and I need to find time to organize and archive them to ensure that new joiners can get up to speed immediately!

Seeing the technical blogs of impressive companies is quite inspiring: [dropbox.tech](https://dropbox.tech)
