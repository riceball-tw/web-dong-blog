The accessibility standards for web colors can specifically refer to the WCAG color contrast guidelines, which classify color contrast into AA or AAA levels. Higher intensity is usually more noticeable and friendlier for more users to identify (this detection standard can be found in Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, or various other tools).

However, it's not that simple. Although the WCAG color contrast is a commonly used standard in the industry, it was born in the era of CRT monitors, and there are many reasons why it is no longer suitable as today's standard. The [APCA](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/APCAeasyIntro) algorithm was thus born and is expected to become the new standard for future WCAG 3.

If you are looking for a compromise solution during this period, you might consider [Bridge-PCA](https://bridgepca.com/), which is 100% compatible with WCAG2 contrast and addresses existing issues.

Strictly determining pass or fail based on color contrast is not a guiding principle and may not necessarily meet the needs of specific users. In fact, when it comes to contrast, the needs of different users can conflict with each other â€” what is beneficial for some may be harmful to others. This even applies to font size. - [APCA in a Nutshell](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/APCA_in_a_Nutshell#failing-passfail)
