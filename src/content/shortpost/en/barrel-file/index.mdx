![Barrel File Example](barrel-file-example.webp)

In simple terms, it is to create a file that imports all modules and then exports them.

The reason for investigating this topic is that my team heavily uses this pattern, but Vite does not perform Tree Shake (removing unused code) during development, resulting in a large amount of useless code being bundled into each development environment, severely affecting the development experience.

Some people believe that barrel files are an anti-pattern with no benefits, while others think that doing so can better organize modules, unify interfaces, and enhance readability.
For more detailed analysis, you can refer to the newly written article: [What is the Barrel File pattern?](https://www.webdong.dev/post/what-is-barrel-file/)
