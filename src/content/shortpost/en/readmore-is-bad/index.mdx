Many times, it is not necessary to display all the information at once; instead, a button is created to let users know "if interested, click here to get more related information."

The problem is that "more" is an ambiguous term.

Crawlers (bots that access websites) do not know what "more" means, users with screen readers do not know what "more" means, and poor UI can also leave people unclear about what "more" is... Leaving the description to be judged by context can easily lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Therefore, do not just tell users whether to "see more" or "are you sure," clearly informing users of the impact of their actions is one of the basic ways to enhance the UX experience.

I wanted to share this topic because I found that many newly planned pages have "see more," while reminding myself that this issue needs improvement ðŸ¥º.
