Recently, this cool feature has been considered for a vote to be removed! The reason is that after being launched for a while, too few people are using it and there are still too many bugs. Firefox had a similar feature in the early days, but it has already been discontinued.

The Layers feature can help you freely preview the rendering situation of the entire webpage from a three-dimensional perspective. You might use this tool for the following purposes:

- Inspecting webpage rendering situations (lazy loading)
- Breaking down webpage animation effects
- Understanding the current page's Z-index hierarchy

For me, the most significant benefit has been understanding the relationship of Z-index levels when resolving issues with some externally imported components recently. It should be helpful for frontend developers who often create special visuals.
