The most effective font is the one you don't notice. No super high x-height, no geometric structure, no eye-catching design, and no confusing ligatures. The [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/) font is designed to be neutral and anonymous, quietly doing its job. You can interact with this font directly on the website through typing, with mini-games, comparisons of existing fonts, and customization features to play with.

So far, the font that suits my taste the most is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#design), which is more mechanical, orderly, and condense compared to other fonts. People tend to read more easily with familiar fonts, so choosing a font that looks good to you and using it consistently is the best fit for yourself~

If you want to try different development fonts, you can refer to: [Programming Fonts](https://www.programmingfonts.org/)
