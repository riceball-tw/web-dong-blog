[Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist) is used to calculate the language proportions in GitHub repositories.

For example, the [TypeScript project](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/.gitattributes) specifically replaces the statistics of all `.js` files with TypeScript, which is why the entire project shows a statistic of `99.9%` TypeScript.

![TypeScript Language Statistics](./typescript-language.webp)

```bash
*.js linguist-language=TypeScript
```

Other uses include excluding specific files or directories from the statistics, which can help us eliminate unimportant information and make the actual project language statistics more accurate (as displayed on GitHub repositories).

```bash
# Exclude specific files
*.md linguist-vendored

# Exclude specific directories
docs/* linguist-vendored
```
