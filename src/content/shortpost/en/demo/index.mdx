Recently, I encountered a requirement to implement a responsive webpage that looks like the one below. It became clear that this layout cannot be achieved using traditional one-dimensional layouts, as the containers they belong to differ between the two sizes.

For example, the sidebar should be contained within the main parent container, but it also needs to align with the top of the intro on larger device sizes. Clearly, such a requirement is difficult to achieve with traditional CSS layouts. Whether using negative `margin` to push elements or `absolute`, `transform`, it can quickly become chaotic and hard to maintain, even requiring JavaScript to calculate positions üòê.

After resolving it with CSS Grid and Subgrid, I felt it was a great case study, so I wrote a complete article: [Real Use Case of CSS Grid: The Process of Creating an Extended Sidebar](https://www.webdong.dev/post/real-use-case-of-css-grid-extended-sidebar/)
