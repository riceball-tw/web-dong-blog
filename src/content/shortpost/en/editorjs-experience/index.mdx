Recently, I encountered the need to create a content editor interface similar to Notion, where users can write articles or embed specific customized components.

[Editor.js](https://www.threads.net/@webdong.dev/post/DBObFgJBHg-) differs from traditional WYSIWYG editors that edit Markdown or HTML; it uses a custom JSON format to store data. While this brings great flexibility, it also requires additional conversion to be used elsewhere since it is not a universal format.

During development, I stumbled upon many pitfalls, such as the entire ecosystem not being particularly active and mature. Some basic features (undo/redo/block dragging/text color) rely on community plugins that have been ongoing for several years, yet many issues remain unresolved.

It can be expected that after installing plugins, there will still be a need for some patching. However, it seems there are no more suitable options in open-source projects, making it suitable for scenarios that require highly customized text editors.
