If you need some search functionality you can checkout to the NPM package - pagefind.

Pagefind is a search package written in Rust and implemented through WebAssembly. Its purpose has been clear from the beginning: "to provide a ready-to-use search solution for any static webpage."

- Fast search
- Provides ready-made UI
- Supports search in Chinese and Japanese
- Supports search for any static files
- Supports categorization, sorting, custom search page meta data, and index importance adjustment

Recently, I completely switched my blog from Fuse.js (a fuzzy search package) to pagefind. I recommend anyone writing a static blog to give it a try; pagefind has just released its official version 1.0.
