Sometimes you want to test what happens when you throw strange data outside the specifications at the software, but you don't have the corresponding data on hand, and collecting or creating it can be troublesome, so you can give it a try.

- Image generation
- File generation
- JSON / CSV generation

All data is generated locally, so the experience is very fast and convenient.
