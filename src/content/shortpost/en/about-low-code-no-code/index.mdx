The failure of tools like Frontpage, Dreamweaver, Adobe Muse... has greatly contributed to our distrust of Low Code / No Code. Nevertheless, I still believe these tools have their shining moments. Local examples like Studioming and TenTen have created stunning commercial works using such tools.

The goal is to make good use of tools to solve problems, avoiding vendor lock-in as much as possible, and learning the truly unchanging fundamentals is key. Breaking down the boundaries between developers and designers, and accelerating product iteration, is a trend worth looking forward to.
