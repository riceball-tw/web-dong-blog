Recently, I've been dealing with CI and thought that if we could feed every PR to AI to automatically identify some simple errors or create document, it could save the entire team time and improve efficiency.

In the end, I chose Codium's PR Agent to integrate into CI, as it is quite common and doesn't feel too vendor-locked. Here are some points I find useful:

- Easy installation (ready-made CI scripts that can be adjusted a bit and put into operation)
- Supports various Git service providers, multiple deployment methods, and customizable models

You can also purchase their PR-Agent Pro, but it's not necessary; just adjusting the configuration file allows you to switch to your own model at any time. If you're interested in putting AI on CI, you might want to give it a try.

As for the actual experience? I plan to use it for a while longer before writing down my thoughts.
