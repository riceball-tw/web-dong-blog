In the process of writing my blog, I learned that the meaning of a static webpage lies in its content, not in its experience. A blog is a very traditional type of webpage: some text, some links that can connect to other pages, and some images and scripts that are not necessarily required.

Therefore, when creating a webpage, planning the content is far more important than how you present it. As the blog upgraded, I focused on refining the overall visual effect but deviated from the original intent. Look at the image below, do you care?

Not really! The point is that I write valuable and opinionated articles, which is why this blog has value. I quite like the current homepage: simple and focused on content, with no unnecessary nonsense. This is why I removed the about page, as it did not bring value to my readers. I will reconsider adding it back only when there is enough content.
