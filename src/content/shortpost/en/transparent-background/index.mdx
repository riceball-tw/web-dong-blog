When I was still taking freelance jobs, I often needed to create visually-driven web pages, and one good way to enhance the quality of a web page through details is "background textures."

On [TRANSPARENT TEXTURES](https://www.transparenttextures.com/), there are nearly a hundred ready-to-preview free web background textures. These small, square, seamless texture images can enhance entire website at a very low cost ðŸŒŸ.
