Speaking of No Code (building websites without coding), it reminds me of a past experience.

During my vocational high school years, I unexpectedly became the school's representative for the "National Skills Competition in Web Design." This competition gathers students from across the country for technical testing, and high scores can lead to special applications to schools. I remember that for about half a year, I didn't have to attend classes and spent every day self-studying web design.

The competition involved first taking some web-related tests, and then spending 2 hours locked in a classroom competing to create a website, with the final results evaluated by judges.

Those who don't understand web design might think it's normalâ€”just like drawing or cooking, where the goal is to see who can do it faster and better within a time limit. But web design doesn't work that way! ðŸ«  At that time, I was under immense pressure: - Poor grades meant no hope for further education > I reluctantly decided to give it a try.

- The teachers didn't understand web design > I had to find my own way.
- Resources were immature > It was still the era of Table layouts and Flash.

In short, on the day of the competition, I proudly used extraordinary perseverance to self-learn web design under a bunch of bizarre conditions and submitted a work that met the latest industry standards. Surely, first place was mine, right?

No, a website created using Adobe Muse by dragging and dropping a few pre-designed modules won first place.

At that moment, I felt utterly foolish (even though I always thought the competition itself was quite silly).

The Ministry of Education holds this competition annually, allowing students from all over the country to compete for superficial accolades in the name of promoting skills, while in reality, it focuses on outdated, off-track, and meaningless things.

Anyway, after a long time, I accepted that this competition wasn't really about web design but rather about the students' ability to think outside the box! I'm curious about how this competition is now and if there are any juniors experiencing similar stories. If anyone has questions about web design, I'm more than happy to help, as I've been stumbling through it since then.
