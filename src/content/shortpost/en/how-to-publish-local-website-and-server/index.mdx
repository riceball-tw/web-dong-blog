First, let's look at these two memes:

ðŸ‘‰ Misunderstanding that other computers can directly connect to local files

Make good use of static web hosting services, upload to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, etc..., to generate a public URL, so others can view the website through that link.

ðŸ‘‰ Misunderstanding that other computers can directly connect to local server ports

Use the internal IP address: On the same internal network (for example, on the same Wi-Fi), you can use the local IP address to access the server, allowing other devices on the same subnet to access it directly through this IP address.
Expose the local server: If you want to access the local server from the external network, you can use tools like ngrok, LocalTunnel, or Cloudflare Tunnel to create a temporary URL that maps the local server to the external network.

Frontend developers often need to test on different devices and browser environments, and the commonly used [VSCode editor actually has built-in Microsoft dev tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding), allowing you to quickly put the development server online for testing with just a few clicks.

Even [Nuxt has built-in support for Cloudflare Quick Tunnels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4nXOFTXI_c)
