As a frontend engineer, theoretically, having multiple browsers in the work environment and regularly testing new features is a basic operation.

However, in reality, we often assume everything is fine when it works in our preferred browser and push the code without thorough testing. Constantly switching between browsers and versions seems impractical and increases overhead. Is there any solution to this problem?

I mainly use Firefox while the rest of my team uses Chrome, and surprisingly, many Firefox-specific bugs are discovered by me - which turns out to be an unexpected form of diversity ðŸ™‚.
