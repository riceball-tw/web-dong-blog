The fear of being replaced by AI stems from the fear that our own meaning will also be replaced, but as humans, creating meaning is an inherent gift. For example, one can carve wood into a spoon, giving the wood the meaning of "a tool for convenient eating." The spoon has strong functionality, but it cannot assign meaning to itself or other things, just like today's AI.

My thoughts:

1. Learn with good tools.
2. Actively seek different meanings.
3. No one can predict the future; if perfect AI really appears, it is human, not a machine, similar to the sudden arrival of imaginative and intelligent aliensâ€”let's deal with it when it happens.
