I’m not mistaken; try pressing the “.” key on any GitHub Repo to open a full VSCode editor. Although there are some limitations compared to local development, it’s still quite impressive!

What stands out is being able to have a complete editing experience when browsing unfamiliar Repos without downloading anything, or being able to edit a project immediately by just finding a computer and opening a browser when the development environment isn’t at hand.
