Clarity: In addition to basic sentence structure, the need for details varies depending on the type of writing, making the choice to retain or omit content equally important.

Personality: A sufficient amount of personality and an authentic voice make readers believe that what they are reading is written by someone who is genuinely interested and knowledgeable about the subject, without hindering the communication of the content.

Consistency: Find a style that is beneficial and preferred by the platform and target audience.

- What common problems do people encounter?
- What misunderstandings or anti-patterns do you often face?
- What new trends or interesting new things are emerging?

Write for yourself, identify the content you want to read, and then write it down. As a developer writing for developers, you are the reader.
