As someone who insists on learning without spending money, I usually learn by browsing official documents, blogs, and YouTube. However, recently while learning NX, I hit a wall. The official documentation was somewhat hard to digest, and there weren't many online tutorial videos available üòê. Just then, I found that [Egghead](https://egghead.io) offers related courses that are completely free! The experience has been excellent, and I was impressed by:

- Courses specifically focused on web development
- The quality of instruction seems quite good
- 3x speed works smoothly, and subtitles are complete
- Beautiful course illustrations made me think, are these really free experiences?! Super value!
