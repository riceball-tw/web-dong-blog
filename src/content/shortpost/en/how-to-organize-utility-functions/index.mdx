As projects expand, many common functions are scattered in different places. Therefore, I took the time to organize a unified structural rule for the team to use. Many times, our impression of these utility functions only stays at the point of extracting them to a certain folder for storage. As for how to manage or maintain these functions, there are not many thoughts, leading to many chaotic situations:

- ❌ Over-abstraction: The logic has been separated, but it seems to have little meaning, instead increasing the cost of understanding and maintenance.
- ❌ Ambiguous naming: Because they are too generic, the names are also very vague.
- ❌ God-level functions: A single function does too many things, making it difficult to maintain.

To address the above issues, I wrote a [new article](https://www.webdong.dev/post/how-to-organize-utility-functions/) summarizing:

- 👉🏻 Real-world problems I encountered
- 👉🏻 Definition of utility functions
- 👉🏻 When to extract utility functions
- 👉🏻 Key points for managing utility functions
- 👉🏻 Practical examples

Actually, I have no concept of whether there are better practices, but I think that such a flexible problem will be solved effectively if the whole team has a consensus and writes it down.
