If there is a very slow website and I can only choose one way to improve it, I would definitely focus on the content of the website itself: images, videos, fonts, audio, because this is the option with the lowest investment but the highest return. You can...

- Consider how detailed the user needs the information and only load necessary content (lazy loading, appropriately sized images)
- Consider the user's environment and adopt more efficient formats that are more suitable for the context (gif / webp) (SVG / PNG)

Most of the time, these aspects that do not require any actual development skills are the main reason that contribute to a poor web experience.

- The above is one aspect of the traditional document nature of webpages. As webpages evolve from their original document nature more towards application experiences, this is indeed an area where developers need to put in effort. Here is an interesting statistic: [JavaScript Bloat in 2024](https://tonsky.me/blog/js-bloat/).
- Even simple images should not be underestimated. I previously wrote a lengthy article delving into the intricacies of web images: [All the tips for optimizing web images are written here!](https://www.webdong.dev/post/all-you-need-to-know-about-optimal-images/).
