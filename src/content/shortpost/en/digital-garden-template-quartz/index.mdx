I often browse different blogs online to learn, and today I came across this static site generator focused on converting Markdown documents into a fully functional digital garden, equipped with many impressive features such as built-in search, backlinks, link previews, multilingual support, Mermaid diagrams, LaTeX, and more.

[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) supports multiple Markdown formats like: Obsidian, OxHugo, and Roam Research, suitable for content creators who don't have time to set up their personal note-taking site, licensed under MIT.
