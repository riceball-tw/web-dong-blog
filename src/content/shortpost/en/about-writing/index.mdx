Recently, many feature-rich note-taking apps have emerged, and suddenly everyone is keen on building personal knowledge bases, constructing a "second brain" or a "life operating system." I was also enthusiastic for a while but ended up either getting lost in tool settings or overcomplicating issues. In terms of running a blog, it was a failure, but personal growth was still greatly aided. As long as I know what I'm doing, that's enough:

- Buying a domain is a waste of money; after building the website, I didn't write any articles.
- Setting up a complete content management system (CMS) to manage content satisfies technical vanity, but I ended up paying for a server that I hardly use. Now, Iâ€™m taking a more relaxed writing approach. Writing should be done in an environment with minimal resistance. After a long day at work, having a mind full of stress makes it hard to write anything. I learned to let go and avoid premature optimization (Premature Optimization) and YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it!)!
