You can add outlines to all web elements using a universal selector. Simply add the following extra styles in your browser (usually, you can open the browser's developer tools and click the + icon to add a new style).

![MDN Outline](./mdn-outline.webp)

![MDN Article Outline](./mdn-article-outline.webp)

```css
* {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```
