Using Cypress to write End-to-End tests always gives me a familiar feeling. I found out that some methods behind it are actually provided by Chai-jQuery. I didn't expect that a technology commonly regarded as outdated is still shining in another field.

I wonder how many people were introduced to frontend development not through JavaScript but jQuery. Just thinking about it brings back memories! But please, don't make me go back to the chaotic internet era ðŸ« .

Speaking of jQuery, it reminds me that someone created an [online operating system](https://puter.com/) with it. Cool!
