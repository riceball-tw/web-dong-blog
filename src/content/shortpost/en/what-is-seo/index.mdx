I categorize "Search Engine Optimization" into two directions for discussion: content and technical aspects.

Search engines visit websites and record the content of the sites. When users input keywords into the search engine, it retrieves relevant websites from its database and displays them to the users. Naturally, search engines prefer websites that are rich in content, have a certain level of authority, and provide a good user experience, as this leads to a better search experience.

In other words, producing valuable web content is the primary requirement, and then we can explore:

- Can search engines correctly interpret the website content? (HTML5 semantic web, rendering modes, multilingual)
- Can they provide additional information to help users preview? (Open Graph, JSONLD, Meta Tag)
- Is the website experience good?

In practice, there are various ways to improve a website's ranking in search engines, such as...

- Finding good titles based on popular keywords in the search area
- Analyzing the website and user experience through tools like ahref, Google Search Console, or Google Analytics
- Using Lighthouse to analyze website performance and best practices

But remember, the ultimate audience for the website should be the users; there is no need to overly please search engines or exploit loopholes. In the long run, search engine algorithms will continue to change, and continuously producing content that is helpful to users is the most important thing.
