Recently, there was a discussion about whether it is possible to introduce Sass to solve some existing problems, and my response was negative:

1. Early CSS features were immature, which necessitated support from Sass (nested selectors, variables, calc, etc.)
2. The additional translation step increases the complexity of the development environment and the cost of learning and maintenance
3. Vendor lock-in

For me, Sass is like CoffeeScript to JavaScript; when the native ecosystem matures, there is no need to use it. Every technology arises to solve underlying problems, and before using additional tools to address issues, one should often ask themselves why they are making such a choice and whether the trade-offs are reasonable.
