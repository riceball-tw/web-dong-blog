With the release of the State of JavaScript 2023, it can be observed that the satisfaction levels of many gradually maturing technologies are declining, such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, Svelte, etc. The summary of [Theo's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdKQczxKwe8) is:

1. As usage increases, people are forced to adopt solutions that are not their own choices.
2. As technologies mature and are widely applied, broader problems need to be solved, thus breaking old habits.

There seems to be a saying that there are only two types of technologies (or anything):

- Those that are disliked
- Those that no one uses
