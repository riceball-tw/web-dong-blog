If you are managing a website or self-media, editing images is a very common task. However, not everyone is a professional designer willing to subscribe to the fully-featured but expensive Adobe suite. Most of the time, the need is just to convert an image format, crop, or compress images. Therefore, I recommend trying Photopea (raster editing) or Vectorpea (vector editing). They are web-based tools that allow for quick editing in any environment as long as you open a browser.

Currently, all the images on my blog are edited using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/):

- Free
- Available anytime, anywhere
- The interface and shortcuts are very similar to Photoshop
- Supports multiple image formats
