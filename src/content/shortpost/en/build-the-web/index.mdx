As a front-end engineer, my recent work has made me realize that many development challenges still revolve around the appearance and interactive behavior of the interface. It strikes me that the cost of developing and maintaining a customized UI is indeed too high for small teams.

On one hand, there’s a desire to "quickly launch products," while on the other, there’s a hope for "high-quality outcomes." This has made it consistently difficult to do the right thing.

Doing the right thing involves achieving performance, usability, maintainability, testability, search engine optimization, cross-platform compatibility, multilingual support, and more. I’ve identified some of the problems that existing teams encounter, as well as key conclusions on how to address these issues:

- Keep the UI simple and straightforward.
- Adhere to browser standards.
- Make good use of existing packages, style libraries, and headless UI.
- Automate documentation development, and encourage designers to adapt to the ever-evolving web.
