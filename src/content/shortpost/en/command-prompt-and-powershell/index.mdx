I often develop on Windows, but I have never really understood the difference between Command Prompt and PowerShell. I always thought PowerShell was just the blue version of cmd.

- **Command Prompt**, a batch scripting language, is traditionally used to execute DOS commands and batch scripts. Its syntax is simple, suitable for handling basic file operations and system administration tasks, and it still exists to support legacy habits and programs.
- **PowerShell**, a scripting language based on .NET, adapts to user habits, automatically mapping DOS commands to their corresponding command sets. For example, the command `cd` actually executes `Set-Location` behind the scenes. In summary: PowerShell is the modern cmd, with more powerful and comprehensive features.

So next time I encounter the two, I won't think of PowerShell as just the blue Command Prompt anymore (although most of the time, there really isn't much difference). I suddenly realized that the programming language that initially inspired me to code wasn't Visual Basic or JavaScript, but Batch Script!
