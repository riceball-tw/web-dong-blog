Has anyone had the same question as me?

- Why is XML (Extensible Markup Language) not called EML?
- Why is AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) transmitting JSON not called AJAJ?

Strange thoughts:

- Because X sounds cooler (?)
- Because EML sounds like Email (?)

According to [Why is XML not called EML?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/88405/why-is-xml-not-called-eml), it turns out it was decided by voting, but it doesn't explain why it had to be X!
