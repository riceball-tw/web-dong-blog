This means that some content placed behind paywalls (I'm talking about Medium) can be bypassed, and by searching through author's personal profile, you can find the author's personal website to read openly. Of course, different platforms have different target audiences, and if managed thoughtfully, the content will also vary different.

Perhaps it's because the only place that can truly be called a long-term "home for content" is a self-hosted platform. Sites like Wretch will shut down, Tumblr and X will change policies, and content on public platforms will always be like leaves swaying in the wind. Therefore, most of the Threads I write will also be stored on my own blog.
