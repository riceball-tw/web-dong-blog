When redesigning the blog navigation experience, I noticed that iPhone's Home Indicator, which covers the navigation bar (Figure 1, left old and right new). Therefore, in the new design, a safe area indicator was set up, allowing the website to use CSS env() + calc() to calculate the actual safe display area for the navigation bar.

1. Add the page Meta attribute `<meta name="viewport" content="viewport-fit=cover" />`
2. Use the [env(safe-area-inset-bottom)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env) variable combined with [`calc`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) to calculate the safe bottom distance for the navigation bar.

Now the Home Indicator no longer covers elements that are on the edge of the screen üëçüèª (Figure 1, left Chrome right Safari)

[env()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env) was initially provided by iOS browsers, allowing developers to place web content within the safe area of the window to ensure that content displays correctly even on non-rectangular screens.
