If you, like me, use a 4K monitor, you probably often use the browser's zoom feature. With more pixels packed into the same screen size, everything on the interface becomes smaller and more detailed. This also led me to notice a unique issue: the `1px` display error caused by browser zoom.

![Shadcn UI 1px Error](one-px-offset.webp 'Shadcn UI 1px Error')
![Google Search Console](search-console.webp 'Google Search Console Strange Checkbox')

For example, I have occasionally observed this issue in Shadcn UI and Google Search Console. It relates to how browsers handle **non-integer pixels after zooming**. Since the smallest display unit on the screen is `1px`, there will be discrepancies in the final display compared to expectations.

[How various browsers should deal with the unsolvable problem of pixel scaling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32184316/html-border-thickness-on-zoom), so there isn't much that frontend developers can try. I've heard that older versions of Chrome tend to make `1px` lines disappear after zooming, and there are some [workarounds](https://muffinman.io/blog/fix-for-chrome-not-rendering-borders/) you can refer to.
