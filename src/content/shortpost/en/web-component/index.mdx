I have known for a long time that browsers began to introduce Web Components APIs and standards, but I never had the opportunity to use this technology in practice. Over time, I found that the application scope of Web Components is becoming broader, and I can also see that major framework packages are successively supporting the use of Web Components, which catched my interest. Simply put, in the face of the current complex frontend demands such as:

- Declarative and concise efficient template systems
- Responsive state and corresponding cross-component communication
- Server-side rendering of Web Components is still impossible ðŸ˜…, and it will not replace existing solutions, but we can expect more implementations of web components to align with the browser's native APIs.

I researched a bit and wrote an article: [Future of the Web - Native Web Components](https://www.webdong.dev/post/future-of-the-web-native-web-components/)
