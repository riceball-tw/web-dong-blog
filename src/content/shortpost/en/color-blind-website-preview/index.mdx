I just found this [Toptal Colorblind Web Page Filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter) that allows you to preview how different websites look under various colorblind filters in real-time. Physiological limitations or environmental factors can affect the accuracy of how we receive information, so it's important to pay attention to user accessibility needs, specifically: WCAG, APCA.

- Protanopia = Red-green color blindness (mainly red)
- Deuteranopia = Red-green color blindness (mainly green)
- Tritanopia = Blue-yellow color blindness
