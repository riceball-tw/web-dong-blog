You might think of pressing F12 to open the browser console and selecting the corresponding node to modify the text, but that's not fast enough!

Try entering in the browser console: `document.designMode = 'on'` , and you can click on any web page element and edit its content. This is a property supported by all major browsers, used for convenient editing of client-side web pages.

Congratulations, you've gained a seemingly useful yet weird piece of web knowledge: [designMode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/designMode).
