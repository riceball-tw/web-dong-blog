Recently, while creating a multilingual blog (Simplified Chinese and English), I happened to see a post on Huli's blog mentioning that he successfully translated hundreds of articles by modifying the open-source chatgpt-md-translator. So, I decided to experiment as well, and the results were quite good!

👀 Observations:

1. Compared to translating literal meanings, AI can provide better translation results based on cultural and domain backgrounds. I don't understand the usage background of Simplified Chinese, such as... 部落格 - 博客, 品質 - 质量? It feels like as a non-native speaker, AI understands language habits better than I do when translating.
2. With Grammarly, I found that AI's grammar is impeccable.
3. Most of the time was spent on manual proofreading, as translations involving deep cultural or specialized domains require special attention.
   If you're interested in the results, you can scroll to the bottom of the [blog](https://www.webdong.dev/en/shortpost/) where there's a globe button to switch languages. I plan to translate the entire website more thoroughly before placing it in a prominent position.

- If you want to jump in and play around, you can refer to the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/riceball-tw/gpt-markdown-translator).
- You can also check out my blog project, using [Git Submodules to link the translation project](https://github.com/riceball-tw/web-dong-blog/pull/133) for convenient translation use.
