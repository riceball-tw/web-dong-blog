Measuring the yield of each developer's code to assess productivity seems like a reasonable decision, but yield does not fully represent productivity:

- **Risk Aversion**: This leads developers to prefer conservative fixes for known bugs, as this approach can largely ensure a low defect rate.
- **Short-term Thinking**: Excessive risk aversion may cause teams to overlook long-term improvements and innovations.
- **Yield Definition and Value are Fluid**: There may be multiple defects reported as a single defect or vice versa, and the severity caused by different defects may also vary, making defects inherently unequal and difficult to measure.
