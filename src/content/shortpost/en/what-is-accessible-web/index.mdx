Similar to the concept of accessible facilities, an accessible web page considers different physical functions and environmental usage experiences. For example, visually impaired users or keyboard users may need the website to have appropriate visual processing or other assistive indicators to ensure that the website information can be accurately conveyed and interacted with, as previously discussed:

- [Why does pressing the Tab key in the browser show a blue outline? - Focus Indicators](https://www.webdong.dev/shortpost/focus-indicator/#focus-indicator)
- [Curious about what websites look like to different types of colorblind users?](https://www.webdong.dev/shortpost/color-blind-website-preview/#color-blind-website-preview)

Does it sound like accessible web pages are special measures for specific minority groups? Not entirely. 
Related to physical decline, harsh environments, limited hardware facilities, habitual preferences, etc., ultimately, accessible web pages aim to create an inclusive user experience, ensuring that everyone can use the web equally and smoothly. 
Finally, I would like to share the website [WhoCanUse](https://www.whocanuse.com/?bg=533399&fg=ffffff&fs=16&fw=), which can simulate the experience differences of the same button for different types of visual impairments or environmental conditions.
