## Pass by Value

> In JavaScript, when the value of a variable is a primitive type, it is pass by value.

When the variable being passed is a [primitive type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#primitive_values), what gets passed is a copy of the value, not the memory location of the variable. We can use `=` to assign a value to a variable. For example, assigning different numbers to `a` and `b`:

```js
const a = 1;
const b = a + 1;
```

Notice in line 2, `b` is assigned the value of `a` + 1, so `b` will be `1 + 1 = 2`. This is very intuitive and easy to understand; this is what is known as "pass by value."

<Info type="info">
  Primitive types specifically include: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null`. Data of these types is
  passed by "value."
</Info>

## Pass by Reference

> In JavaScript, when the variable is not a primitive type, it is pass by reference.

When a variable is an object or an array, JavaScript needs to keep track of its memory location, so **what is stored in the variable is not the actual content, but the memory location of that content**. For example, in the following diagram, the variable `b` actually holds the memory address:

```js
const a = 1;
const b = [1, 2];
```

<div class="flex items-start  md:gap-4 gap-2">
  <table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>b</td>
        <td>0x01</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Memory Address</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0x01</td>
        <td>[1,2]</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

After understanding the concept of pass by reference, let's extend the previous example. If we have a variable `c = b`, the diagram would look like this:

```js
const a = 1;
const b = [1, 2];
const c = b;
```

<div class="flex items-start  md:gap-4 gap-2">
  <table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>b</td>
        <td>0x01</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>c</td>
        <td>0x01</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Memory Address</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0x01</td>
        <td>[1,2]</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

As a result, both `b` and `c` point to the memory location `0x01`, so when we modify `c`, `b` will also change:

```js
let a = 1;
let b = [1, 2];
let c = b;
b.push(3);
// Result: both b and c become [ 1, 2, 3 ]!
```

This is why the values of `b` and `c` both become `[1, 2, 3]`, because `b` and `c` both point to the same memory location.

## Equal but Not Equal

After understanding the difference between passing by value and passing by reference, we realize that memory locations and values are entirely different things; one is a pointer, and the other is the content, just like the example in the following chart.

```js
const a = [1, 2];
const b = [1, 2];

console.log(a === b); // false
```

<div class="flex items-start  md:gap-4 gap-2">
  <table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>0x01</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>b</td>
        <td>0x02</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Memory Address</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0x01</td>
        <td>[1,2]</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>0x02</td>
        <td>[1,2]</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

```js
let a = [1, 2];
let b = a;
console.log(a === b); // true
```

<div class="flex items-start  md:gap-4 gap-2">
  <table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>a</td>
        <td>0x01</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>b</td>
        <td>0x01</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <table style="display: table;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Memory Address</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0x01</td>
        <td>[1,2]</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Summary

Understanding how JavaScript stores variables helps in better data manipulation, avoiding situations where modifying A inadvertently affects B.
