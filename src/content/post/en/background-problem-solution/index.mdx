## Introduction

Recently reading [Stay SasSy](https://staysaasy.com/) mentioned [Goals, Problem, Solutions](https://staysaasy.com/management/2021/07/24/goals-problems-solutions.html) made me realize this is how I break down problems at work! It’s a perfect match, and I want to write an article to share this method for achieving consensus, which is also a great way to communicate upward, helping both the team and superiors.

We all encounter situations where the team cannot reach a consensus or does not know how to achieve one, or you need a process in meetings to ensure everyone can clarify the overall situation and reach a consensus. I recommend the method I often use: "Goals, Problems, Solutions."

## Goals, Problems, Solutions

The process mentioned in [Goals, Problem, Solutions](https://staysaasy.com/management/2021/07/24/goals-problems-solutions.html) is roughly as follows, and **the key is that one step must be completed before moving on to the next**:

1. **Goals**: Ensure everyone has a consistent purpose; it’s better if there are quantifiable objective values.
2. **Problems**: Ensure everyone understands and agrees on the current issues.
3. **Solutions**: Ensure everyone has a consensus on how to solve the problems.

> Solutions and self-esteem can easily intertwine — "My idea is the best, and if you disagree with my proposed solution, it’s like implying I’m foolish."

**Solutions are subjective, while goals and problems are relatively objective**, making it easier to discuss from an impartial perspective. Once there is a common contextual background of the problems, effective solutions can be sought together, encouraging subjective solutions based on objective perspectives. Applying this process, I find it easy for everyone to be on the same boat when facing problems.

Our understanding of problems is often limited; it’s very likely that we have common goals and problems but propose different solutions based on differing understandings of the problem's background. Therefore, I will particularly **describe the background of known problems or observed phenomena** after the goals when necessary, which also helps colleagues with [context switching](https://staysaasy.com/leadership/2023/09/24/dont-bring-me-problems-bring-me-solutions.html#context-switching) to quickly understand the overall picture of known issues.

- Goals: What needs to be achieved
- Background: What is known, what has been tried
- Problems: What is faced, what is not understood
- Solutions: How to meet the goals?

## Conclusion

The "Goals, Problems, Solutions" method is very simple; it can establish mutual understanding before arguments, clarifying the boundaries and endpoints of the issues. I don’t think arguments are bad, but the ultimate goal of arguing should be to seek consensus.

Solving problems requires rationality. If rational people cannot reach a consensus or [disagree but commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit) to a solution, it’s likely that the goals or problems themselves are inconsistent.
