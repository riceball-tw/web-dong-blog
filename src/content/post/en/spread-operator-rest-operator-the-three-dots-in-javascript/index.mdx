## What Are the Three Dots?

The `...` operator can be used in arrays and is a useful syntax that makes data processing more concise, quickly expanding content into a new array. It has two usages:

- Spread Operator
- Rest Operator

The syntax is the same with three dots, but the effects differ based on their positions.

## Spread Operator

<Video

  data={[
    {
      type: 'webm',
      src: 'images/posts/spread-operator-rest-operator-the-three-dots-in-javascript/spread.webm',
    },
    {
      type: 'mp4',
      src: 'images/posts/spread-operator-rest-operator-the-three-dots-in-javascript/spread.mp4',
    },
  ]}

It can "spread" an array into individual values or convert iterable objects such as `String`, `Array`, `TypedArray`, `Map`, `Set`, the [`arguments`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) in functions, the [`HTMLCollection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection) and [`NodeList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) in the DOM into arrays.

### Example 1: Spread and Add Arrays

```javascript
const foo = [1, 2, 3];
const bar = [4, 5, 6];
const foobar = [...foo, ...bar]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Spread the `foo` and `bar` arrays and merge them into the `foobar` array. The spreading is done by shallow copying, meaning the values in the `foobar` array are **copies of the values from the `foo` and `bar` arrays, not references**. This method of spreading and copying is suitable for creating a new array without modifying the original arrays.

### Example 2: As Function Parameters

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

addThreeNumbers(...[0, 1, 2]);
```

The spread values can be used as function parameters, eliminating the need to pass each parameter one by one.

### Example 3: Convert Array-Like or Iterable Objects to Arrays

```html
<ul id="list">
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
const list = document.querySelector('#list');

console.log(list.children);
// HTMLCollection(3) [li, li, li]

console.log([...list.children]);
// [li, li, li]
```

Or convert some array-like objects into arrays, which allows array-like objects **to become true arrays and use array methods**.

## Rest Operator

<Video
  width={1600}
  height={600}
  data={[
    {
      type: 'webm',
      src: 'images/posts/spread-operator-rest-operator-the-three-dots-in-javascript/rest.webm',
    },
    {
      type: 'mp4',
      src: 'images/posts/spread-operator-rest-operator-the-three-dots-in-javascript/rest.mp4',
    },
  ]}
></Video>

The purpose of the rest operator is clear: it is used to collect the remaining parameters into an array, packaging "all remaining" parameters into one array, and it must be the last parameter in the array. If no values are passed, it will be an empty array.

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, number) => total + number, 0);
}

sum(1, 20, 30, 2); // 53
```

## Object `rest` and `spread` Properties

The rest and spread of arrays are ES6 syntax, while the `rest` and `spread` properties of objects are syntax introduced in ES2018, with similar usage.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };

const { a, b, ...rest } = obj;
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
console.log(rest); // { c: 3, d: 4 }
```
