## Introduction

When using packages, one often wonders about the general process of managing package development. Today, I encountered Matt Pocock's [Blazing Fast Tips: Publishing to NPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh89VE3Mk5g) tutorial and implemented it, also publishing a TS package based on my previous needs: [edit-element](https://github.com/riceball-tw/edit-element).

  The action version and package manager (pnpm) used in this tutorial are not absolute; choose what works best for you.
</Sidenote>

## 1. Install TypeScript

1. Initialize a new NPM package.
2. Install the latest version of TypeScript.
3. Initialize a basic TypeScript configuration file, which will generate a default `tsconfig.json` that can be modified as needed.

```bash
pnpm init
pnpm add typescript -D
npx tsc --init
```

Finally, you can directly execute `tsc file location` to transpile the `.ts` files into `.js`:

```bash
pnpm tsc foo.ts
```

## 2. Convert Module Format

The awkward part is that the JavaScript ecosystem has two module systems: CommonJS and ES Modules. Therefore, we use the [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) package to quickly bundle the `ts` files into the required format. After installation, set the script to be triggered in the [NPM Scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts) section of `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsup index.ts --format cjs,esm --dts",
},
```

The setup is also very simple; just specify the location of the TS files and the types to convert, with the default output in the `dist` folder. After generating different types of package files, **remember to label the files corresponding to different module systems**.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "module": "dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
}
```

## 3. CI Process

Now you can perfectly edit `index.ts` and push your package to NPM using tsup! However, the entire code release process is still not very smart. Itâ€™s best to **perform a check and build on the code every time there is a code push**. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) can conveniently achieve this by creating a simple workflow file in `.github/workflows`:

```yaml title="ci.yml"
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 9
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm run lint && pnpm run build
```

## 4. Automate Semantic Versioning Releases with Changeset GitHub Actions

With the CI process in place, we can further consider **how to automate the deployment process as well**. Install [@changesets/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@changesets/cli) and add a new Workflow to automate using [changesets/action](https://github.com/changesets/action):

```json title="package.json"
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup index.ts --format cjs,esm --dts",
    "release": "pnpm run build && changeset publish",
  },
```

```yaml title="publish.yml"
name: Publish
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [CI]
    branches: [main]
    types: [completed]

concurrency: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  publish:
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 9
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20.x
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Create Release Pull Request or Publish
        id: changesets
        uses: changesets/action@v1
        with:
          publish: pnpm run release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

Regarding the environment variables that will be used:

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Grant necessary GitHub permissions by [setting `permissions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/controlling-permissions-for-github_token). This variable is preset.
2. `NPM_TOKEN` - Log in to [NPM > Access Tokens](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens) to set up a key for read and write access to your account, and place it in [GitHub Env](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables).

Once set up, you can run `npm run changeset` anytime you want to change the project version and input the types and details of the package versions to be updated, which will automatically generate a temporary markdown file.

To push the version later, you can use `npm run changeset version`, which will automatically update the package version. After committing, the previously written Publish process will detect version differences and automatically deploy to NPM and [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases).

## Summary

If you prefer learning through videos, I recommend watching Matt Pocock's [Blazing Fast Tips: Publishing to NPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh89VE3Mk5g) tutorial, but be aware that the package version is lower, and some adjustments are needed. The latest progress should be checked in the [mattpocock/pkg-demo](https://github.com/mattpocock/pkg-demo) repository.

Through this tutorial, I also created my own package: [edit-element](https://github.com/riceball-tw/edit-element), and expanded it with additional testing processes and environments for reference.
