## Establishing the Project

<Sidenote type="success">
  With basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you can follow this article to create your own portfolio.
</Sidenote>

This article will use my own portfolio website as an example, utilizing [Astro.js](/post/why-you-should-try-astro/) as a static generator to efficiently manage and generate all pages within the website, taking this opportunity to showcase the usability and power of this framework. Before starting, you can read the previous article: [Let's Build a Personal Frontend Portfolio - Preparation](/en/post/lets-build-a-portfolio/) to plan the entire portfolio in advance, or set up a suitable development environment: [Setting Up ESLint and Prettier for Astro](/post/setting-up-eslint-and-prettier-in-astro/) .

<Sidenote type="warning">
  This project example uses Tailwind as the method for writing CSS. You can refer to the previous article: [Using
  Tailwind Without Learning It](/en/post/use-tailwind-without-learning-it/), and choose the method that suits you best.
</Sidenote>

<Sidenote type="warning">
  This project has set up Alias for path replacement. You can refer to the [official Alias
  documentation](https://docs.astro.build/zh-tw/guides/aliases/).
</Sidenote>

First, use the Astro creation tool in the terminal to initialize and decide on your settings:

```shell
# Create an Astro project
npm create astro@latest

# Ask if you want to install the create-astro package, enter y to confirm
Need to install the following packages:
 create-astro@3.1.7
Ok to proceed? (y)

# Where do you want to create a new project? (./project name)
Where should we create your new project?
./dangerous-debris

# How would you like to start your new project? (Introduce sample files / Import blog template / Blank)
# Select blank
How would you like to start your new project?
- Include sample files (recommended)
- Use blog template
> Empty

# Install dependency archives? (whether)
# Select Yes
Install dependencies? (recommended)
- Yes - No

# Planning to use TypeScript?
# Select Yes
Do you plan to write TypeScript?
- Yes - No

# TypeScript mode? (Strict/Most Strict/Loose)
# Choose the most rigorous
How strict should TypeScript be?
- Strict (recommended)
> Strictest
-Relaxed

# Initialize a Git repository? (Optional)
# Select Yes
Initialize a new git repository? (optional)
- Yes - No
```

Once the project is set up, you can `cd ./project-name` to enter the project, use `npm run dev` to start the development server, and use `ctrl+c` to close it.

## Astro Basics

Before writing the website, there are some knowledge points about Astro that need to be filled in, but it won't be too complicated. Here, I will briefly introduce them:

### [Project Structure](https://docs.astro.build/zh-tw/core-concepts/project-structure/)

![A blank page with an Astro title](./blank-setting.webp)

Now, when you start the development server, you will find that apart from the "Astro" title, there is nothing else on the screen. This is because the empty project was chosen earlier. The project contains different default generated files and folders, each with its own purpose:

- `src/*`: Project source code
- `public/*`: Unprocessed resources (exactly the same as [Vite public](https://cn.vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory), static resources can be placed here)
- `package.json`: Records project package information
- `astro.config.mjs`: Astro configuration file
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file

### [Routing](https://docs.astro.build/zh-tw/core-concepts/astro-pages/)

Creating pages in Astro.js is very simple. It is based on file routing, allowing you to directly write `.astro`, `.html`, `.mdx`, or `.md` files and place them in folders. During generation, corresponding static pages will be created based on the file names and locations. For example:

- Creating a new file: `src/pages/foobar.astro` is equivalent to creating a new page under `/foobar`.
- Creating a new file in the hello folder: `src/pages/hello/world.astro` is equivalent to creating a new page under `/hello/world`.

### Component Scripts and Templates

```astro
---
// Component Script (JavaScript / TypeScript)
---

<!-- Component Template (HTML + JS Expressions) -->
```

The beginning of an `.astro` file will have three dashes, referred to as the "Component Script." The content inside the dashes will be executed when the Astro component is created. For example, you can:

- Import other Astro components
- Import other frameworks, like React
- Import other data, like JSON
- Fetch third-party data
- Create variables for use in templates

The block below the dashes is the "Component Template," where you can write HTML. To use the data from the component script in the component template, you can use syntax similar to JSX. For example, you can convert an array into an HTML list using the `map` method:

```astro
---
const items = ['A', 'B', 'C'];
---

<ul>
 {items.map((item) => <li>{item}</li>)}
</ul>
```

At this point in the tutorial, you should realize that what you need to do is write basic HTML and JavaScript. You have already grasped the power of the `.astro` file!

## Creating Pages

A website usually has many repetitive segments. Using the methods learned earlier, you can break the webpage into component files that can be imported when needed. Here, I created a [Base](https://github.com/riceball-tw/wei-wei-web/commit/bdcfe6d81c6b9394ec36e92097b9990bb55ab325) component for the overall website, which includes references to the [Navbar](https://github.com/riceball-tw/wei-wei-web/commit/b82f540940a1d284537e25f6df94b4a3cb59549d) and [Footer](https://github.com/riceball-tw/wei-wei-web/commit/09abfc94f689bae1b1af1eb31b4c4f39a7ee4766) components, as well as the [Banner](https://github.com/riceball-tw/wei-wei-web/commit/932f7f9f50acdea6f727e9ce81f0b14846d1b262) component at the top of the page.

```astro
---
import Base from '@/layouts/Base.astro';
import Banner from '@/components/Banner.astro';
---

<Base title="Home">
  <main class="min-h-auto md:min-h-screen">
    <Banner>
    <h1 class="px-4 font-semibold text-3xl md:text-6xl">
    Hello, I am Joe,<br />
    I have written more than 50 <a class="highlight" href="https://www.webdong.dev/post/">technical articles</a> to record and convey knowledge, helping 800
    Please help more than 100 students to clear their doubts. Check out my <a class="highlight" href="/work">portfolio</a> to see how I solve real-world problems.
    </h1>
    </Banner>

    <section class="mb-16">
    <h2 class="sr-only">Latest Works</h2>
    <div style="background-color: black;" class="mx-4 flex aspect-video justify-center rounded-lg">
    <video class="h-full w-full" width="720" height="540" autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="">
    <source src="/assets/global/hero.webm" type="video/webm" />
    <source src="/assets/global/hero.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    </div>
    </section>
  </main>
</Base>
```

This way, a homepage has been created. Isn't the development environment clean and tidy? Next, you can use the same techniques to create the [About](https://github.com/riceball-tw/wei-wei-web/commit/f82c2c6ee438f76f7844400cbbc0c0c6fba2118a) and [Works](https://github.com/riceball-tw/wei-wei-web/commit/3731d120194367106edf0e255e903a1041e2b81a) pages, and even a [404 page](https://github.com/riceball-tw/wei-wei-web/commit/cae2d37c9657c0debc34cfb8eefb680bed57e0fe). The principle is exactly the same!
