## Introduction to HTML Element Attributes

HTML elements can have their own attributes to express various types of information, such as appearance styles, accessibility information, and various default properties, as shown below:

```html
<div class="names" role="region" aria-label="Names"></div>
```

But when it comes to adding custom data to some elements, can we record the state and data of events in HTML? Specifically: the display state of a window, the type of functionality of a button?
The answer is yes, but it's not as straightforward as directly writing attributes on the tag, as shown below:

```html
 <!-- `highlight` is not a valid attribute -->
<div highlight="true"></div>

<!-- `large` is not a valid attribute -->
<div width="large"></div>
```

Although the above methods achieve the goal of adding custom data in HTML, several issues arise, and it is strongly discouraged:

- It is invalid HTML syntax, which will cause errors (attributes or values do not exist, or are not allowed)
- It may cause conflicts in the future (HTML is an evolving language; this custom attribute currently has no meaning in HTML, but that does not mean it won't in the future)

The good news is that by simply adding the [data-\*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*) prefix, HTML recognizes this as a "custom attribute," resolving the above two issues.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html 
<!-- Define data however you want -->
<div
  data-name-item
  data-first-name="Joe"
  data-last-name="Doe"
  data-active
></div>
```

Compared to recording the state of data in id or class, it is recommended to use data attributes for selecting elements and recording data.

## Reading Data Attributes

Continuing from the three custom data points in the `<div>`, you can first select the node with that custom attribute using `querySelector`:

```javascript
const foobar = document.querySelector('[data-name-item]');
```

Then use the dataset property to retrieve all custom data attributes (returns an object):

```javascript
// Input
console.log(foobar.dataset)
// Output
{
  "nameItem": "",
  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "active": ""
}
```

You can use dot notation or bracket notation to read this object.

```javascript
console.log(foobar.dataset.firstName); // Joe
console.log(foobar.dataset[lastName]); // Doe
```

Interestingly, the originally kebab-case data values are converted to a lower camel case format. Additionally, data attributes with no value will automatically be assigned an empty string as content, while completely non-existent attributes will return undefined, which should be noted.

## Updating Data Attributes

Changing data attributes is as easy as modifying a regular object, and you can use the two methods mentioned above to change them.

```javascript
foobar.dataset['firstName'] = 'new';
foobar.dataset.firstName = 'new';
```

## Deleting Data Attributes

Deleting a data attribute is as easy as deleting a regular object, and you can use the [delete](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) method.

```javascript
delete foobar.dataset;
```

## Summary

Data attributes are a formal way to store data in HTML, allowing both JavaScript and CSS to access the data of elements directly within client-side elements.

- Data attributes can freely embed custom attributes into HTML elements.
- The attribute names of data attributes must be in lowercase and at least one character long.
- Data attributes can be added to any HTML element.

<Info type="warning">
  Before using data attributes, be sure to check for existing attributes (ARIA attributes) or elements that can more
  accurately describe the purpose of the data. Custom attributes should be considered a last resort.
