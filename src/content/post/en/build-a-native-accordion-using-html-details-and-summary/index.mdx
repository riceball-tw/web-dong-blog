## Introduction

<Sidenote type="warning">
  At the time of this article's publication, only browsers with the Chromium engine generally support
  [interpolate-size](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_interpolate-size) and
  [::details-content](https://caniuse.com/?search=%3A%3Adetails-content) syntax, so it's normal for animations to fail
  in other browsers.
</Sidenote>

An accordion is a common web UI pattern, typically [a series of vertically interactive headings used to toggle the display of further information](https://component.gallery/components/accordion/), and it also has additional names such as:

- Collapsible
- Details
- Expandable

In HTML, the new syntax `<details>` and `<summary>` helps us quickly implement similar functionality, along with the new CSS `interpolate-size` and `transition-behavior` for smooth open and close animations.

## Basic Accordion

HTML has added `<details>` to allow us to express expandable sections natively, where `<summary>` represents the title of the section, as shown in the example below:

```html
<details>
  <summary>Section Summary Title Here</summary>
  Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad consectetur nisi repellendus atque. Praesentium mollitia
  sapiente libero aspernatur. Hic ipsa id eveniet sapiente totam soluta exercitationem iusto, quaerat delectus ratione.
</details>
```

<details>
  <summary>Section Summary Title Here</summary>
  Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad consectetur nisi repellendus atque. Praesentium mollitia sapiente
  libero aspernatur. Hic ipsa id eveniet sapiente totam soluta exercitationem iusto, quaerat delectus ratione.
</details>

## Grouped Accordion

To bind multiple accordion states, you can use the same `name` attribute, which will force only one accordion with the same `name` attribute to be open at a time:

```html
<details name="exclusive">
  <summary>Section 1</summary>
  <p>Content for section 1.</p>
</details>
<details name="exclusive">
  <summary>Section 2</summary>
  <p>Content for section 2.</p>
</details>
```

<details name="exclusive">
  <summary>Section 1</summary>
  <p>Content for section 1.</p>
</details>
<details name="exclusive">
  <summary>Section 2</summary>
  <p>Content for section 2.</p>
</details>

## Default Open Accordion

To set a specific accordion item to be open by default, you can use the `open` attribute:

```html
<details open>
  <summary>Section 1</summary>
  <p>Content for section 1.</p>
</details>
```

<details open>
  <summary>Section 1</summary>
  <p>Content for section 1.</p>
</details>

## Adding Animation

To select the content of details, you can use the [::details-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::details-content) pseudo-element. By setting different heights and `transition` in the open state, you can animate based on the open and close states.

```css
details::details-content {
  background-color: red;
  height: 0;
  transition: height 1s;
}

details[open]::details-content {
  height: auto;
}
```

### Animate Height: `interpolate-size: allow-keyword`

You may find that even with the addition of `transition`, there is no animation for `height` when the element expands or collapses. In the past, this issue was unsolvable, and we could only use JS to calculate the height and change properties to achieve animation effects. Fortunately, there is now a new experimental CSS syntax: `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` that helps us calculate `animation` and `transition` for properties like `auto`, `fit-content`, and `max-content`. It is a style setting that can be inherited by child elements, so it works whether set at the document root or on individual elements:

```css
:root {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}
```

### Animate Visibility: `content-visibility`

You may notice that when collapsing, there is no animation, and it simply disappears. This is because the content visibility is set to 'hidden' when the accordion is closed. We also need to set up related animations for this, and it is a [discrete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties#discrete) animation! This means there are no intermediate states or values, and you need `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` to ensure that the switch occurs only after other animations are completed:

```css
transition: height 1s, content-visibility 1s;
transition-behavior: allow-discrete;
```

## Summary

If you follow the steps above, you will have a minimally functional native accordion with nice open and close animations!
